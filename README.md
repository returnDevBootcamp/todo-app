## The todo app!

We will develop a todo app which you can list down things you need to do today! We shall be using Node.js for the first time. This application will help us understand the CRUD (Create, Read, Update & Delete) operations 😊.

The application will be the like one below. In this repository you will have the starter pack. Let get coding! 💪🏾
